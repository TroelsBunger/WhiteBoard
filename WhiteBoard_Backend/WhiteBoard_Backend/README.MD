## Introduction
Backend project for a whiteboard application where users can post different types of posts and comment the different posts and so on.
Created in .Net Core 

## Requirements
Can be run from localhost and with postman etc. 

## Notes
Is to be considered a work in progress. As of now, there are quite a few known errors. Requires another day of work to be up and running - through some serious refactoring and with tests added. Adding a frontend would be another nice bonus, however, hasn't been implemented yet.
